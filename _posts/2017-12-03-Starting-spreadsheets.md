In our first IT lesson of the academic year we started a new topic on spreadsheets. We started off very simple by learning how to do sums. We learnt lots of the terminology for the actions and how to do basic sums between cells as well. Then we we shown how you could use spreadsheets as a shop owner. We made our own shopping list with items and their prices. The third column had the quantity and we created a sum which multiplied the quantity by the price and stretched that down all of our products. Also, we learnt some helpful tips like writing 'false' at the end of the sum because we had not written the products in alphabetical order. Then we made a search bar which would also have a prediction drop down bar as you were typing. In the end we had a search bar that would find your item and tell you the price of the quantity you had put in, you could make multiple search bars for more than one item. We had basically built a programme which would produce a receipt for the customers shopping which was easy to make and would be very helpful.
