    <td>In our team we found the most effective strategy was having one person reading the manual and directing the other on the keyboard. I think that this was effective because we got through the tasks very quickly. Also I would read out the code litterally for example i would say 'space' when there was one.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that i did not always know exactly what the code was doing as most of the time i just read the code that we needed to type in. Also I think sometimes Ethan was confused as i was reading the code out literally and he didn’t know whether to type ‘space’ or just add a space</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time i will probably say to my partner before we start coding that if i don’t say anything in between words then he should assume there should be a space between them. In addition i need to read the all the detail on the specific page of the manual we are using thoroughly before i just read out the code to my partner. I think this will help as i will understand what the code is supposed to achieve. This will help me to notice when the code is incorrect as i will know what the result is supposed to be.</td>
