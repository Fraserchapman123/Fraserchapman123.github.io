    <td>I often got stuck but I used the w3schools website to find the solution every time. For example, on the website you can find instructions on how to add a background image.
I also thought that looking back at the previous commits helped me when I had a code error. Whilst using the fuze box, i found it easier to stick to the manual which guided me through the work. Also i payed close attention to the details so that i could pick up as much informations from the booklet as possible.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to sense when it's right to stop guessing and actually find out the solution especially when I was trying to fix the code. I think that i got a little bit stuck when the manual wasnt 100 percent correct and was denying that it was anything else because i thought that i must stick to the manual.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>next time I will try not to waste time on one problem and try to resolve it more logically
Also I need to make only one change at a time as if one went wrong then I spend forever trying to fix it. Also when using the fuze box i should have just tried things if something wasn't quite right which is what i ended up doing. </td>
