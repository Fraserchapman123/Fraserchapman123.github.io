# **Layers of coding**

There are many different layers of coding from binary to python, binary only has two commands, on and off whereas python has so many different commands which makes it less complicated to program although it may seem like there are more things to worry about. In todays lesson, we all talked about the different instructions or commands you would have to use to make a cup of tea. At first we all assumed that a person was taking these instructions which meant that we were not decomposing the commands. For example the first command we thought of was 'fill the kettle with water'. Seems simple enough if you are a human with some common sense, but a robot would have lots of problems. The robot would not know how much water to put in and therefore would never stop and the kettle would overflow. Also the robot might not take the lid off as the command does not tell it to. The point of this lesson was to teach us how to process commands as if we were a computer and have no knowledge. Part of this is decomposing commands, we have to think about the problems that a robot would face by breaking the command down and seeing if the command is clear enough for the robot or console to succeed. Being able to think like this would allow us to spot problems with code and fix them much easier as we would always be thinking about how the computer sees the code and that the computer has no common sense or knowledge.
