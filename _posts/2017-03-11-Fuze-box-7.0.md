    <td>once again I read the manual and my partner typed into the fuze box. To save time I used some short cuts like saying the word speech to signify to him that he should put speech marks around the text and a few different ones as well like when I said the line started with HVTAB then said two numbers, he would know to put the numbers in brackets and use a comma.</td>

    <td>in the past few lessons we have not been making as much progress as before and we need to just rattle through the code instead of stopping and starting which slows us down. Also we need to communicate better so as we do not have to keep on going over the last line again.</td>

    <td>Next time we need to flow through the code more and make more progress. We can achieve this by communicating better and listening so that we don't have to go back and forth through the code and lose time.</td>
