In this IT lesson we tried to make a code using python 3 that would determine whether or not the number was even. Later on in the lesson we moved onto making a prime number. We were told that finding new prime numbers can be worth millions as they are important in computer cryptography and their odd mathematical properties make them ideal for current uses. So we started with the 'is it even'  code. I made a function called is_even using ‘def’. Then i used modular division to test for the remainder when the number ‘n’ was divided by 2. If the remainder returned as 0 i knew that it was even and if it returned as anything else then it was odd. Once i had completed that we moved onto the prime number finder which was a lot more challenging. Firstly, can say that 2 is a prime number and write that part of the code first. Then i ruled out all of the even numbers above apart from 2 by using the code that i created earlier in the lesson. After being given some clues by our teacher, we were able to work out that we needed to work out the square root of the number in question in order to find out if it is prime or not. After doing some research i found that if a number is prime, it’s square root is irrational and cannot be expressed as a fraction as it;s decimal places will go on forever without repeating itself.
