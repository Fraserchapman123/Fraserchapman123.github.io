    <td>I made lots of progress through Python exercises in this lesson. I think that the key this time was that I kept all options open when solving problems. This worked as in some cases the answer was much more simple that I thought, and just try all, possible options, even if you doubt them, payed off .</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I was slowed down by the fact that I was easily distracted and this meant that when i focuses my concentration on the exercise again, I had lost my train of thought and so this slowed me down too.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will always be thinking about the job in hand and whether am making enough progress and if I need to work harder . Also I will try not to have lapses in concentration during an exercise as I might lose my train of thought.</td>
