In our last lesson of the half term we we shown how to organise our quizzes to make them more concise. To do this we used lists. Firstly, we created a function called "ask_question" which was the template for the questions. After we made this we then had to write in each question and their answers in square brackets in the correct order which corresponded to the template. To finish off the code we had to use a 'for' loop inside a function called “ask_the_questions”. This function had the instructions telling repl what to do with all of the questions and answers inside the lists. Finally i had to call the function and the quiz would run.
