Python coding

In our first IT lesson of the final school term we started a new topic. We are moving on to learning raw code using the code academy website. We are focusing on python which is a coding language and there are vast amounts of lessons on the website which we are going to work on throughout the course of the term. We need to complete around 60 percent of the lessons by the end of this term and to add to that this is quite a short final term. This means that in every lesson i need to be fully focused on the task in hand and make good progress in every lesson. I feel that i did make good progress in the first lesson as i got used to the layout and completed nine percent of the lessons.
