After planning our quizzes and writing the questions last week, this lesson we began coding the quiz. We started with the core, i decided that my quiz would use a points tally and your result at the end would depend on the questions you gave. For this i needed to create variables for every possible result, my quiz is about sports, there are six options. Football, rugby, cricket, tennis, golf and athletics.  After the question was printed the you are asked to answer with letters corresponding to your answer. If the answer is not one of these then a message is displayed and the question is re printed. This is done using a while loop and a variable, 'answered'. The actual answer is recorded using ‘if’ to add points to each of the variables depending on the answer.
