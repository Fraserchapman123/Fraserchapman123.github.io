This week we continued with python coding from where we left off last week. The coding exercises this week were a big step up and very challenging. The tasks get progressively harder and you get less and less help as you go forward. After i quickly finished the controls and conditional flow section i moved on to function. This was very complicated as there were so many things that you had to agree with each other. Even if the code was legitimate, it could still be wrong as the functions might not agree. The three functions that we used were if, else and else if which shortens to elif. When it says 'if' that is then followed by something like 5<6 and if this is true then the program will do the following piece of code underneath. This might be something like ‘print hello’.
