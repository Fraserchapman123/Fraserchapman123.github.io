# **Three weeks of Python **

For homework we had to spend two hours overall on python. Although, we had to spread it out across the three weeks without IT lessons due to exams and half term. Here is a table of when and for how long i went on python.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>When i used python</td>
    <td>How long i worked on it for (mins)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>16th May</td>
    <td>15</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>18th May</td>
    <td>10</td>
