This year has been great in IT. I feel like I have made lots of progress and not just in the coding exercises but in they way that I will deal with the new world as well when I finish school. Although I made a lot of progress in coding, I think that I have learnt a lot of life lessons too. This is because our tacher would often stop us and talk to us about something that could help us in later life. Once we were told that computing is vital in almost every job we will have. Mr keen also talked about why we should work hard at school and also how life isn't always fair and that we need to take initiative and put more effort into achieving things. He thinks that the only thing that is stopping us from achieving great things is us. Whether or not we can be bothered to put the effort in.
