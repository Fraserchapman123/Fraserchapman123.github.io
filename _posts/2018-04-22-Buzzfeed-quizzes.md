We started today's lesson by completing quizzes on the buzzfeed website. After completing a few we discussed the quizzes and the main point that came up was that these quizzes were inaccurate and based on guessing rather than evidence from the questions. One quiz even tried to guess your favourite colour. We were then set with the task of making our own quizzes that were hopefully more accurate than those from buzzfeed. This lesson we focused on the content of the quiz and next week we will start trying to work out the maths of the quiz.
