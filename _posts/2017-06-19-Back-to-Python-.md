    <td>When working through the tasks i found that the most effective method was reading the explanation first then trying the exercise. I also found that the hint is very helpful when i get stuck. When i was on something for a while i found most success working logically and following the hint exactly.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I think that sometimes i wasted time trying random things when i got stuck and this halted my progress slightly. Also i think that sometimes i jumped into the exercise too quickly and didn't read the the description properly</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time i need to think more logically and literally when i get stuck as that is how a computer thinks. Also, i should read the description for each exercise more carefully so as i understand the task in hand instead of just trying to put pieces of code together without fully understanding.</td>
