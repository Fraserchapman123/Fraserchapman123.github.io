Overall I worked well a was very productive in getting through the exercises and made good progress in today's lesson. However the main thing that I learned was that coding is vital for almost every career in later life. If I asked you to think of a job that didn't need some knowledge of computing, you would struggle. The only thing I could think of is being a professional sportsperson. In every other job you will need some level of knowledge about computing.  If you go into a job and have no knowledge of computing, you won't succeed. There will be others who know their way around a spreadsheet and are more knowledgeable when it comes to computers. They will be ruthless and take advantage of the fact that you cannot use a computer and they will be able to easily manipulate you. They will also be able to misrepresent things without you noticing and therefore trick you into doing things you wouldnâ€™t otherwise do if you knew what the were talking about. Overall, the skills of computing are very important in later life as they can aid you with your job
