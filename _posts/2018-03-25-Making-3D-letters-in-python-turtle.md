Last lesson we created the code that would draw letters with spacing. This lesson we attempted making them 3D. First we tried to make these letters in bubble writing which didn't prove too difficult. Then we had to figure out how to make them 3D. We worked out that the angled we wanted was 45 degrees from the bubble version of the letter in order to get the correct proportions. I worked on this for homework and managed to make a 3d F and a bubble C but i struggled to make the C 3D due to the curves and the way that iâ€™d drawn the C in the first place.
