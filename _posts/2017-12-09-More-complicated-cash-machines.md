This week's lesson was focused  making our formulas for a cash register more complicated on spreadsheets. We introduced discounts to our spreadsheets. This meant that we could toggle a certain discount whenever we wanted. The type of discount we did depended on the amount of items the customer was buying. In this case we had a 20% discount if you bout 5 or more items from the shop. Firstly we set up the discount by setting a formula which would multiply the final sum by 0.8 to take 20% off of the price. Then we had to filter this to only take off 20% when they bought over 4 items. So we made a total box under the quantity column and wrote a formula that said ' if the total quantity is greater than or equal to the cell with ‘5’ in it then do the sum for 20% off." Notice how the sum doesn’t say if the total quantity is greater than or equal to 5, it says ‘is greater than or equal to the cell’. This allows me to go back and change the amount of items they need to buy in order to get a discount without changing the formula as it will just take whatever number is in the cell at the time.
