Today was our last lesson in spreadsheets and we will be starting a new topic next lesson. N today's lesson i finished up on my virtual shop. The most important thing that i did today was the discount option in the spreadsheet. II had tried to do this before and failed however this time i used Mr Tansley's spreadsheet to help me with some of the formulas and i managed to get the discounts to work perfectly. The total price reacts to the rest of the spreadsheet when it is changed which means that there is a lot less hassle when i want to change the percentage discount or the amount of items required.
