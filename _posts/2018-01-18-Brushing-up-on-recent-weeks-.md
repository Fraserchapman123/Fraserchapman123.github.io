Today we focused on making sure that our blogs were up to scratch. We also embedded our Google sheet with our virtual shops on them into our previous post. In this lesson i cleaned up my website to make it look a bit more clean. Also, we recapped on everything that we had done on google sheets and what formula we used to create an easy to use, virtual shop. This included fixing my receipt list that didn't add up correctly as an error would appear if nothing was selected in a certain item box. I corrected this by adding another set of brackets and writing 'iferror’ at the start and a comma at the end. This basically means if there’s an error then do nothing. I also attempted to add a discount option but i didn’t quite finish that.
