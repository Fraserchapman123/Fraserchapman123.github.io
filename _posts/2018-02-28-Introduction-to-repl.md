In today's lesson we began a new topic using the repl.it website. First of all we had to choose a coding language and in this case we used python turtle. We started the script by writing the code 'import turtle’. We had to think about how you would programme a computer to draw shapes. We started with a square and began with the simple code. This told the computer to draw a line of a certain length, then turn 90 degrees and repeat this four times. Later on we made the coding more advanced so that we could just put in the amount of sides we wanted on the shape and the side length. We did this using local variables in the code "def draw_shape(sides, length)". Next we programmed the computer to draw multiple shapes without writing out separate codes for each. Again we used variables and also the function “for number in range (3, 8)”. Then we used our command ‘draw shape” and the number variable to finish the code.
