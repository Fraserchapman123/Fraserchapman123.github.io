# Continuing with Python

This lesson we were continuing with python on codecademy. I had made very good progress in the first lesson last week's homework. I had completed 19 percent of the coding lessons and i thought that i could complete lots more again this lesson. Although, i did not make as much progress in terms of the percentage as the tasks get harder as you progress through the coding language. This lesson we started working on strings and console output which involves using true and false statements using symbols like greater than or not equal to in between numbers, within that we used two conditions 'or' and ‘and’. If you had two statements with or in between, only one of them had to be correct for the statement to turn out true, whereas if you had and in between them, both statements had to be correct for it to turn out true and print on the console.
