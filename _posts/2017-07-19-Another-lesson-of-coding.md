    <td>I worked through the exercises well by reading the description thoroughly to make sure that I understand the task in hand. Also I used the hint just to nudge me in the right direction. This made sure that I wasn't just doing trial and error and I actually had a valid approach that saved time and helped me to find the best ways to complete the tasks, quickly.</td>

    <td>This lesson I think that i had too many lapses in concentration as sometimes  as wasn't as productive as normal.This meant that sometimes I would get stuck on a question and be there for too long as I was not thinking well enough to find a way around it.</td>
