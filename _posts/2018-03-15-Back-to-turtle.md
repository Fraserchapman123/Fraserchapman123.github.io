In this week's lesson we went back to the python turtle language and coding your turtle to draw things. We started off the lesson by working out all of the correct angles and lengths needed in order for your turtle to draw the letter 'A’.  We needed to work out the degrees that the turtle needed to turn at each corner and the length of each line. We also use the turtle.back function to move the turtle back up the second line to then go and draw the line across the middle. This meant that we didn’t need an extra line of code to turn the turtle around. Then we were tasked with coding the turtle to write our initials and the letter ‘A’. Writing multiple letters brought up a a problem. How would you get from the end of the first letter to the starting point of the next without joining up the letters, that was relatively easy to solve, you simply use the penup command. However the actual moving of the turtle was the hard part as you had to work out the coordinates of the starting point of the next letter in order to use the goto command. Once i’d done all of that i was left with three evenly spaced letters that were not joined up[ in python turtle.
